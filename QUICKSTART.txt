==================================
SIMPLE RAG PIPELINE - QUICK START
==================================

This guide will help you quickly get started with the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.

PREREQUISITES:
-------------
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Minimum 2GB RAM, dual-core CPU
- About 1GB free disk space

GETTING STARTED:
--------------
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running on your system.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd GuestLectureCS3820_liveDemo2025

3. Make the script executable (REQUIRED for macOS/Linux):
   chmod +x reset_rag.sh

4. Start the RAG system by running:
   ./reset_rag.sh

   NOTE: On Windows (without WSL), you may need to run "sh reset_rag.sh" instead.

   This script will:
   - Stop any existing containers
   - Clear any previous data
   - Start the RAG system with the TinyLlama model
   - Wait for the system to be ready (may take up to 1-2 minutes on first run)

5. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8501

USING THE RAG PIPELINE:
---------------------
1. Upload Documents:
   - Go to the "Upload Documents" tab
   - Upload files in any supported format (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
   - Click "Process Documents" to index them
   - Wait for processing to complete

2. Ask Questions:
   - Go to the "Ask Questions" tab
   - Type a question related to your documents
   - Click "Get Answer"
   - View the answer generated from your documents

3. Reset or Clear Data:
   - Option 1: Click the "Clean Vector Store" button in the Upload Documents tab to clear all indexed documents without restarting
   - Option 2: Run ./reset_rag.sh again to clear all data and restart the application

TROUBLESHOOTING:
--------------
- If the application doesn't start, check:
  docker-compose logs -f webapp

- If document processing fails for certain files, try:
  - Ensuring the file isn't corrupted
  - Converting the file to a simpler format (e.g., PDF to TXT)

- For any other issues, check the README.md file

Happy questioning!
